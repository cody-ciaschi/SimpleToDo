# SimpleToDo
This is a simple to do list written in React to get used to using lists in React.

## Usage
To use this application: 
- Make sure you have NodeJS version 14
- Clone the repo
- Ensure you have http-server installed
- run `http-server -c-1`
- Enjoy!

## Future Improvements
In the future I would like I might add some more styling and create actual buttons for deleting items. I also want to add a strikethough item for things that are clicked.
